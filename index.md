Hi!  I am Marcelo Lares, an astronomer working in
[IATE](http://www.iate.oac.uncor.edu)

 
My primary research interest is the analysis of
astronomical data, mainly using Big Data and statistical learning
tools, to learn about the processes that shape the structures we see
in the universe at many different scales.
